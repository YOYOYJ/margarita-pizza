to make a pizza first step is to make the dough out of flour water and yeast.

next is to nead the dough and let it ferment it for 4 hours with olive oil and covered with a cloth on top.

while the dough is farmenting we will make the marinara sauce.

you might need a parent around cause things are going to get hot.

we will take some fresh tomato pure and it's okay if it store bought,take the pure in pot,on stove with medium heat.
we will then crush the pure finly and add some fresh hebs on top with some crush basil.

let jump into some fun part the rolling polling.
in this step we will take our dough and roll it out in whatever shape you want a star,a rectangle,a circle whatever you want.

once you shape the dough and done with the sauce it's assembly time.

we will gather all the things and some freshly made moozzerela and some cheddar cheese.

gently pour the sauce and spread it,and come of both cheeses,i prefer them in chunks,after that if you like then put sone basil leaves on top.

last but not the leas place it in the oven 220 C for 15-20 min.

bon appetit your delicous pizza is ready to serve hot.
